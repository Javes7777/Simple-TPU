# Simple-TPU
It is a Simple Tensor Processing Unit Students. We applied our digital design knowledge and various FSM principles to implement the hardware components and circuitry necessary to compute simple machine learning (ML) operations. The heart of the core will be the Matrix Multiply Unit (MMU), capable of matrix multiplication, interfaced with IOs and memory (SRAM cores) that store data required of processing Deep Neural Network (DNNs) workloads. The core will support various modes of operation, including initialization &amp; setup, compute, and activation. 


Note: This project has been given to us by Dr. Anita Tino in ENSC 252- Fundamentals of Digital Logic, in the fall of 2020.
Yes , I am doing it in 2021---just crazy for quartus love.
